BenKen Stage Pro V26.16 — MIDI, continuous lyrics and song tempo

GITHUB WEB UPDATE
Upload these files to the ROOT of the existing GitHub repository:
index.html, sw.js, benken-runtime-v26-16.js, benken-ui-v26-16.css,
manifest.webmanifest, icon-192.png, icon-512.png, SUPABASE_SETUP.sql,
and the demo folder. Wait for GitHub Pages publishing, then reload until
V26.16 appears. Keep a .benken backup before updating.
The iPad_MIDI folder is a separate Xcode project, not a web asset.
This package has not been uploaded to your GitHub repository automatically.

WHAT CHANGED
- Duration-synced lyrics move continuously through marked sections instead
  of holding a section and then jumping. Mark each section start using
  SYNC LYRICS. Without markers the existing duration-based scroll remains.
  Timing is estimated within each section, rather than word-level karaoke.
- SONG controls all stems for the current song and remembers its level.
  Your previous per-song master level becomes this SONG level automatically.
- MASTER is now a separate overall level, shared by all songs on this device.
  Hide it under Mixer Settings > AUDIO & FILES > Audio output and more
  options > Show master fader. Hiding it keeps its current level and mute.
  Both faders support double-tap / double-click to return to 0 dB.
- MUTE GROUPS is a mixer tab next to OUTPUTS / BUSES. It shows the six mute
  buttons, membership summaries and a shortcut to edit assignments.

TEMPO IN BPM
In the mixer, open TEMPO. Enter the original BPM and the desired playback
BPM, then APPLY while playback is stopped. Both values are saved per song.
Example: Original 120, Playback 108 = 90% speed, same pitch.
ORIGINAL TEMPO resets Playback BPM to the stored Original BPM.
The supported range is 75–125% of the original (BPM inputs 20–300).
The original BPM must be entered accurately; this is not automatic beat detection.
Preparation applies a common pitch-preserving time-stretch map to all stems.
Audio files are not rewritten or re-encoded. Separate USB routing is retained.
Waveform, seek, song length and saved lyric-section markers follow the new tempo.
Tempo preparation takes extra time and temporary decoded memory. The 256 MiB
working-memory limit still applies. A large song can play at original tempo
but fail preparation at a different BPM. Choose ORIGINAL TEMPO in that case,
or use fewer/shorter/mono stems. MP3 does not lower decoded memory by itself.
Check musical sound quality and click clarity before live use; this version's
time-stretch processing has automated pitch/synchronization tests, not hardware
or listening validation on your iPad/Ui24R.

MIDI / FOOT CONTROLLER
Settings (gear) > SCENE > MIDI / FOOT CONTROLLER.
MIDI can also be assigned as a bottom control using Customize controls.
1. Connect the MIDI interface and press CONNECT.
2. Choose an action, press LEARN and press the desired FCB1010 footswitch.
3. Repeat for START, STOP, NEXT, PREVIOUS, mute groups or other actions.
The learning press assigns the control and does not execute its action.
START is idempotent; PLAY / PAUSE toggles playback.
CC, Program Change and Note messages are supported. CC value 0 / note-off
is ignored for buttons. Expression-pedal volume assignments accept CC 0–127.
Program Change numbers are displayed as 1–128 (raw MIDI values are 0–127).
MIDI channel and message number are captured by Learn. Conflicts are reported.
Input selection and assignments are saved on this device, outside song projects.
FCBFF may configure the original FCB1010; BenKen does not send SysEx or alter
its programming. Configure one consistent message per intended action.

MIDI ON IPAD / MAC
Safari on iPad does not expose Web MIDI. The web update alone cannot receive
your hardware pedal in Safari. FCBFF does not change that browser limitation.
On Mac, a Web MIDI browser such as Chrome can receive the pedal directly.
For iPad, the included iPad_MIDI folder contains an Xcode companion app source
project using Apple's Core MIDI and this same hosted BenKen web interface.
It supports a wired MIDI interface and the system Bluetooth MIDI pairing panel.
A stock FCB1010 needs a MIDI interface or an external Bluetooth MIDI adapter;
it does not gain Bluetooth just by installing FCBFF.
See iPad_MIDI/READ_ME.txt for build and transfer steps.

STORAGE AND COMPATIBILITY
Existing songs, original audio files, setlists and section markers stay in
these stores: benken-ipad-v4 / benken-audio-v1. No cache clear is required.
A new .benken export uses project format 4 to prevent older app versions from
silently ignoring playback tempo. V26.16 reads project formats 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Song tempo and SONG level travel with projects; device MASTER and MIDI
assignments stay on the receiving device. Safari and the iPad companion app
have separate local storage: export a .benken project in Safari and import
that copy in the companion app. Original cloud files stay untouched.

VERIFICATION
Automated DOM, Web Audio, project-transfer, MIDI message, tempo DSP, pitch,
scrolling and regression checks were run. Actual Safari/iPad touch layout,
FCB1010/Ui24R, Bluetooth pairing and the Xcode build require testing on Apple
hardware. This package is source code, not a signed app or TestFlight release.
