BenKen Stage Pro V26.17 — mixer fit, slow scrolling and BPM controls

GITHUB WEB UPDATE
Upload these files to the ROOT of the existing GitHub repository:
index.html, sw.js, benken-runtime-v26-17.js, benken-ui-v26-17.css,
manifest.webmanifest, icon-192.png, icon-512.png, SUPABASE_SETUP.sql,
and the demo folder. Wait for GitHub Pages publishing, then reload until
V26.17 appears. Keep a .benken backup before updating.
The iPad_MIDI folder is a separate Xcode project, not a web asset.
This package has not been uploaded to your GitHub repository automatically.

WHAT CHANGED IN V26.17
- The console now reserves the combined width of SONG and MASTER, including
  Narrow mixer and phone layouts. Their fader rails have compact internal
  spacing so they stay within the strips.
- Slow autoscroll retains fractional pixels in a reading layer, compensating
  when the browser rounds native scroll offsets. Pause/resume preserves the
  visible position. Manual seeks and font-size changes still follow timing.
- TEMPO now has one main Playback BPM field with -/+ buttons (1 BPM per tap).
  Tap APPLY while stopped to prepare and save the new tempo.
- Original BPM & detection contains the source BPM field and DETECT ORIGINAL
  BPM. Existing {tempo: 120} / {bpm: 120} song metadata can prefill the BPM.
  Audio detection analyzes a prepared click/drum/backing stem locally. It
  produces an estimate, not a guarantee of the original musical beat.
  Check half/double tempo using the 1/2 and 2x buttons, then USE ESTIMATE.
  APPLY commits the source/playback BPM. No estimate is saved automatically.
  A regular click track is the clearest reference. Silence, sustained notes
  or material without a clear beat can require manual BPM entry.

FEATURES RETAINED
- Duration-synced lyrics move continuously through marked sections instead
  of holding a section and then jumping. Mark each section start using
  SYNC LYRICS. Without markers the existing duration-based scroll remains.
  Timing is estimated within each section, rather than word-level karaoke.
- SONG controls all stems for the current song and remembers its level.
  Your previous per-song master level becomes this SONG level automatically.
- MASTER is now a separate overall level, shared by all songs on this device.
  Hide it under Mixer Settings > AUDIO & FILES > Audio output and more
  options > Show master fader. Hiding it keeps its current level and mute.
  Both faders support double-tap / double-click to return to 0 dB.
- MUTE GROUPS is a mixer tab next to OUTPUTS / BUSES. It shows the six mute
  buttons, membership summaries and a shortcut to edit assignments.

TEMPO IN BPM
In the mixer, open TEMPO. Set or detect the original BPM under Original BPM
& detection, choose Playback BPM using the field or -/+, then press APPLY
while playback is stopped. Both values are saved per song.
Example: Original 120, Playback 108 = 90% speed, same pitch.
ORIGINAL TEMPO resets Playback BPM to the stored Original BPM.
The supported range is 75–125% of the original (BPM inputs 20–300).
The original BPM must be correct. Detection is a suggestion; confirm the beat
before applying a speed change. Manual entry remains available.
Preparation applies a common pitch-preserving time-stretch map to all stems.
Audio files are not rewritten or re-encoded. Separate USB routing is retained.
Waveform, seek, song length and saved lyric-section markers follow the new tempo.
Tempo preparation takes extra time and temporary decoded memory. The 256 MiB
working-memory limit still applies. A large song can play at original tempo
but fail preparation at a different BPM. Choose ORIGINAL TEMPO in that case,
or use fewer/shorter/mono stems. MP3 does not lower decoded memory by itself.
Check musical sound quality and click clarity before live use; this version's
time-stretch processing has automated pitch/synchronization tests, not hardware
or listening validation on your iPad/Ui24R.

MIDI / FOOT CONTROLLER
Settings (gear) > SCENE > MIDI / FOOT CONTROLLER.
MIDI can also be assigned as a bottom control using Customize controls.
1. Connect the MIDI interface and press CONNECT.
2. Choose an action, press LEARN and press the desired FCB1010 footswitch.
3. Repeat for START, STOP, NEXT, PREVIOUS, mute groups or other actions.
The learning press assigns the control and does not execute its action.
START is idempotent; PLAY / PAUSE toggles playback.
CC, Program Change and Note messages are supported. CC value 0 / note-off
is ignored for buttons. Expression-pedal volume assignments accept CC 0–127.
Program Change numbers are displayed as 1–128 (raw MIDI values are 0–127).
MIDI channel and message number are captured by Learn. Conflicts are reported.
Input selection and assignments are saved on this device, outside song projects.
FCBFF may configure the original FCB1010; BenKen does not send SysEx or alter
its programming. Configure one consistent message per intended action.

MIDI ON IPAD / MAC
Safari on iPad does not expose Web MIDI. The web update alone cannot receive
your hardware pedal in Safari. FCBFF does not change that browser limitation.
On Mac, a Web MIDI browser such as Chrome can receive the pedal directly.
For iPad, the included iPad_MIDI folder contains an Xcode companion app source
project using Apple's Core MIDI and this same hosted BenKen web interface.
It supports a wired MIDI interface and the system Bluetooth MIDI pairing panel.
A stock FCB1010 needs a MIDI interface or an external Bluetooth MIDI adapter;
it does not gain Bluetooth just by installing FCBFF.
See iPad_MIDI/READ_ME.txt for build and transfer steps.

STORAGE AND COMPATIBILITY
Existing songs, original audio files, setlists and section markers stay in
these stores: benken-ipad-v4 / benken-audio-v1. No cache clear is required.
A new .benken export uses project format 4 to prevent older app versions from
silently ignoring playback tempo. V26.17 reads project formats 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Song tempo and SONG level travel with projects; device MASTER and MIDI
assignments stay on the receiving device. Safari and the iPad companion app
have separate local storage: export a .benken project in Safari and import
that copy in the companion app. Original cloud files stay untouched.

VERIFICATION
183 automated tests passed, plus the chord-display regression checks. These
cover modeled DOM/Web Audio, project transfers, MIDI, tempo DSP, pitch, BPM
detection, fractional scroll motion and CSS width constraints. Actual Safari/iPad touch layout,
FCB1010/Ui24R, Bluetooth pairing and the Xcode build require testing on Apple
hardware. This package is source code, not a signed app or TestFlight release.
